## 🎯 1. Problem Statement `[TO AMEND]`

AI-Vive-Banking runs large-scale direct marketing campaigns - but these are costly and resource-intensive. Without intelligent targeting, many efforts go unrewarded. To improve outcomes, the bank needs a way to identify which clients are most likely to respond positively, so resources can be directed where they will matter most.

This project aims to:

- ✅ Build and evaluate **four** robust classification models to predict the client's subscription decision

- ✍️ Identify and explain **key features** influencing term deposit subscriptions

- 📈 Deliver **actionable insights** to optimize campaign effectiveness and resource use

By leveraging the data and predictive models, this project ultimately supports AI-Vive-Banking in **streamlining operations**, **boosting customer engagement**, and **maximizing financial returns**.
